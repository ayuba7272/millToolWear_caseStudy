# Case Study
This repo was created with the intention of doing a ML case study demo for mechanical engineering students.

## Pre-requisites:
- Basics of Python programming for data analysis. Refer this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). Learning Python basics would be really helpful for following along during the case study.
- OPTIONAL : Install Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda / PIP is mandatory to execute code and follow along during the session. Refer this [link](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook/#:~:text=written%20in%20Python.-,Installing%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20using%20Anaconda,-Anaconda%20platform%20also) to install the same.
- In case you do not have Jupyter installed, we will be using Google free version of Jupyter called [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). This is Google's free version of Jupyter Notebooks available for research purposes.

## About the data
The dataset used was the CMC milling tool wear dataset from Kaggle. You can see more details about the same at this [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shasun/tool-wear-detection-in-cnc-mill/code?datasetId=18653&amp;sortBy=voteCount)
